# Notes

Hi,

I like to add a `NOTES.md` file to my freelance projects to keep track of any gotchas in the codebase, or any other information I'd like a future developer (possibly myself) to be aware of. I also use it to track my progress throughout development. This is meant to be a more technical counterpart to the `README.md` file that is standard across all projects.
